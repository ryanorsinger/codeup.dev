	<h1> WE ARE ASSIGNING A FUNCTION TO A VARIABLE </h1>
	<br>
	<h2> How cool is it to call the return of a function as a variable </h2>
	<br>
	<h3> Functions and their returns can be treated like other primitive types in JS. </h3>

	<script>
	   	var a = 1;
	   	var b = 2;

	   	var randomNum = function() { 
	   		return Math.floor((Math.random()*100)+1)
	   	}

	   	alert(a + randomNum());
		
// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three
// print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For 
// numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
