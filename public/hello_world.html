		<h1> Hello World!</h1>
			<p> My name is Ryan. I am <em>inspired</em> and 100% <strong>committed</strong> to my input, output, and returns from CodeUp! 
			<br>

				And that means that I'm in it to win it.
				<br>I'm here for breakthroughs. And break-downs happen. But the good news is that break-downs are only possible when the possibility of a break-through is on the table. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p> My professional background is IT support and IT systems administration </p>

		<h2> My favorite quotes are from two authors:

			<ul>
				<li> L is for Linux. </li>
				<li> A is for Apache. </li>
				<li> M is for MySQL. </li>
				<li> P is for PHP. </li>

		<h2>Questions I'm often asked</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt> How did you troubleshoot that? </dt>
				<dd> My approach is to isolate and control for variables. I also trust my gut. </dd>
				<dt> Do you think a background in tech support and systems administration helps with programming? </dt>
				<dd> They share a similar approach to troubleshooting. So, yes. </dd>
				<dt> How are your CodeUp exercises going?</dt>
				<dd> I get the big picture but I'm having some trouble with the details of X,Y, and Z </dd>
				<dt> Have you done any of the PHPeople or CodeUp challenges yet? </dt>
				<dd> I'm still working on some of them. Want to compare note and do a code review together? </dd>
