		<h1> Hello World!</h1>
			<p> My name is Ryan. I am <em>inspired</em> and 100% <strong>committed</strong> to my input, output, and returns from CodeUp! 
			<br>

				And that means that I'm in it to win it.
				<br>I'm here for breakthroughs. And break-downs happen. But the good news is that break-downs are only possible when the possibility of a break-through is on the table.

			<h3><blockquote> <strong><em>"Don't be the turkey"</em></strong> - Nassim Taleb</blockquote></h3>

	<p> HTML is <em>seriously</em> awesome!</p>

	<p> CodeUp is <em>undeniably</em> awesome!</p>

	<p> What I am telling you is <strong>really important</strong>!</p>

	<blockquote> This blockquote tag = The best part about CodeUp is that I am the lynchpin in my own success </blockquote>


		My page is all about the HTML CodeUp exercises and my progress.
